# LaunchPad ðŸš€ :: React + Redux + Semantic-UI Starter Kit
### Inspired & (sorta) Forked by the *[react-redux-starter-kit](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit) crew*! Make sure you check out their AMAZING work!


The differences between the original kit and this are that this bolts on Semantic-UI (React-version) for componentization. Some other plans will be made in the future, and perhaps split onto another branch (e.g. Electron app, Chrome Extension, Native, etc)... but for now it's a pure playground mess :). I would've forked to pick up their post beta changes, and may actually manually merge that in the future -- but I figured I won't be able to keep pace with those guys, so will cross that bridge when I get to it!


### Why YARCSTL (Yet Another React Component Style & Theme Library?
Honestly, as working in the front-end for over ten years, you see things come and go -- but the odd thing is the hordes of Material-UI influenced libraries, which are mostly all very well documented -- and have great support from the get go. Bolt on, start importing and exporting, throw in your Redux and you're jamming. 

> As a UX/UI Designer & Engineer, I tend to believe that when everything starts looking, feeling, and acting the same; we become bored, frustrated, and usually annoyed at how one application utilizes Material-UI/React-Toolbox/etc. but delivers the UX in different ways. Many times, designers are following very similar patters when it feels like there's so little contrast in how applications and the interfaces we use become stale.


## Why Semantic-UI?

 Call me selfsh. From my ES5 days, I've always loved Semantic-UI. Partly because of the flexibility and range of options, but how well it was able to engage the user in a variety of shape, color, layout, and identity. Basically, it was a Designer + Developer's playground to craft a user interface. Not to say that Material isn't, and we all know and love how amazingly well detailed Google has been in their pursuit of brand integrity, styleguide, and uniformity when it comes to the Material look. | I just want to be able to utilize a different library that: 


1. I love and know very well
2. Adapt a fantastic React + Redux boilerplate and fuse it with a phenomeal UI Library
3. Build my own skills and see how far I can take a project like this. Could this just be another boilerplate? Or could it be a full featured Electron/Chrome Extension/React Native project?
4. I know I have plans to utilize something similar when I get to the point of wiring everything up appropriately -- as I'm sure many others will as well. 

**Who knows though, by the time that comes, we may be back into scrolling text and the blink tag :).**

## Goals
#### Not Listed in any particular order:

- Components (stateless)
- ATOMIC Design approaches
- Readability
- Performance
- Testing
- Theming

Hopefully during the process (I'm working on this mostly to bolster my own greater knowledge of React, ES6, and other libraries, so things like the following are definitely on the table:  


- D3.js
- Socket.io
- WebRTC
- Natve HTML5 API (facades)

Likely a lot of the implementations may come from well established npm/git repos, teams, and myself. This is just a hobby, and a deeper dive. Don't expect things to go flying by, but definitely feel free to show some love if you're into this idea :)!

## About Me:
> Design-first approacher, creative, believer in code-as-art, an ES5 pro turning ES6 better day by day (thank you late night caffiene beverages and the hordes of people smarter than I am.  

> I've worked in various markets, companies, startups, contracts, sales engineering, and more JavaScript frameworks than I'd like to remember (RIP ExtJS ðŸ˜‚). I'm huge on usability, but I believe in the art of allowing people to intuitively be able to use an application which leaves them feeling satisfied; not frustrating. 

> You can learn more about me at my website [www.philearley.com](http://www.philearley.com) and more about my background. My future plans are to keep learning more technology, and helping companies, people, and individuals power open-source solutions which make like better for ALL of us!
